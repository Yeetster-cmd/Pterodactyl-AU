# Pterodactyl-AU
This shell file will make updating both the Pterodactyl Wings and Panel a 1 command job.

This was started off as me being lazy to type 3 commands in, but I saw it as a ease of access type tool, this is why I decided to upload it to Github

(Project will receive mostly minor updates)


HOW TO USE:

``1.Download the files using git``

``2.Use "chmod +x ptero-update.sh" to give it permission to run``
(If chmod doesn't work try using ``sed -i -e 's/\r$//' ptero-update.sh``)

``3.Run script with ./ptero-update.sh``

``4.Profit``
